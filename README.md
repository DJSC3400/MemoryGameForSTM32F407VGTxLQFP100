# MemoryGameForSTM32F407VGTxLQFP100
In this project, we made a goal to recreate a game from a video and set of instructions. The game is a number guessing and memory game. The game materials include 1 button, 6 different LEDs, 7 seven segment display, and one decimal keypad. We used the STM32F407VGTxLQFP100 microcontroller chip, and a keypad.
